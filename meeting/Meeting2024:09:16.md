About:

- The meeting discussed about how to imporve quality of a voice message or a music, and how we eliminate noise in it. The voice message is mostly like pure music without any human voice inside.
- We talked about the methods to improve the quality of the voice message or music, the way of gettign dataset is downloading music from online, and convert them all together to be Mel spectrogram. We also need to include some low quality music data to train our model. 

- Train set 70%, Test set 30%, wo will need to reduce dimention.

- Also there is possiblity to let AI generate music by itself with prompt provided.

- method using cnn + transformer




Here Haotian Also mentioned another idea of what project should we do, which is like "https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/guitar-chords-wav" this project, it's all about music stuff.



Another idea mentioned by Xinyao is doing a project like "https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhinavsuri/anatomy-image-visualization-overview-rsna-raids", which looks like a image classification to identify disease? probably.
