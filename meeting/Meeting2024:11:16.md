About:

We have discussed how to prepare our model, including:
    1. Data collection, we probably need scrapper or api to get enough data for training
    2. Data preprocessing, we need to clean and normalize the data
    3. Methods about how to train our model, using transformer and refer to how AlphaFold make their model.
